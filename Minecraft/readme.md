!! DO NOT TRY YET !! Preliminary Version !!

## What you'll need

* A Raspberry Pi Zero with Raspbian
* A [Unicorn pHAT or HAT from @Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-phat)
* A vanilla Minecraft client that supports Minecraft protocol versions 1.8 to 1.11
  (See below what client may work or not)

## Setup options

You can install the components where and how you want.
The various dependencies are listed in the sources (requirements.txt, package.json).

However, Docker and the pre-built images we provide for the Pi render the experience plainless.

### Setup with Docker

* Install the Docker engine on the Pi `curl -sSL get.docker.com |sh`
* Pull the images
```
docker pull actuino/actuino/unicorn-display-client:1
docker pull actuino/actuino/unicorn-server:1
docker pull actuino/actuino/cuberite-webhooks-armhf:1
```
* Run the 3 components
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 actuino/unicorn-display-server:1
docker run --privileged -e DISPLAY_SERVER_HOST=192.168.7.3 actuino/unicorn-display-client:1
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 25565:25565 actuino/cuberite-webhooks-armhf:1
```
(replace 192.168.7.3 by the actual IP of the Pi)

### Enjoy

* When running actuino/unicorn-display-client, a default scheme should appear on the physical display.
* Connect your Minecraft client to ip.of.the.pi:25565 
* Craft !

### Debug

* Point a brower to http://ip.of.the.pi/ and test the server/client flow.
* Run the cuberite image with `-it` flags, or attach to the running docker container: you'll see the log output of the server.
* Head over to our [Actuino blog post for help](http://www.actuino.fr/raspi/minecraft-raspberry.html).

## Compatible Minecraft clients

Microsoft released several incompatible versions of the Minecraft client (protocol as well as features differs).
The cuberite server supports Minecraft protocol versions 1.8 to 1.11. That is, the legacy Mojang clients, not the last Microsoft ones.

The best choice is to use a legacy Minecraft client: 
Classic edition, also known as Minecraft: Java edition, Minecraft for Windows or Minecraft for Linux.
(costs about $25)

The Minecraft Windows 10 edition is not compatible.
The Minecraft Pi edition is a stripped down version, not compatible either.

You may try http://wiki.vg/Client_List for alternative open source clients (not tested yet, tell us if you did!).
